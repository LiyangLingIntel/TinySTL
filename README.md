# TinySTL

As a newbee to c++ programing and engineering, reimplement [C++ STL](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/) would be a effective way to improve coding ability.

This TinySTL will be a subset of C++ STL, and I'm planing to add some extra data structure and popular algorithm into it.

Almost code will be finished in C++, and tested by Google [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
